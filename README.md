# OMD
Open Music Distribution

Music distribution today is fragmented and consists of copying the same assets and metadata to multiple locations. This creates an information architecture that does not provide the essential infrastructure for managing music catalogue across numerous channels and services.

OMD proposes a different approach to distribution; one that reverses the traditional push method and creates a single point of truth that is controlled by the creator. This happens through a number of specifications that seek to separate concerns and counter power consolidation.
